# Holistics Project

The goal of this project was to create a small dashboard in [Holisitcs](https://www.holistics.io/). Find the link to the dashboard below as well as a link to the [Loom](https://www.loom.com/) video which documents the project and presents the analysis. This repository also stores the raw data as well as the SQL queries used in the project.
