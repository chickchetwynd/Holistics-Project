#  :bridge_at_night: How fast can you make a dashboard??? :sunrise_over_mountains:

The goal of this project was to orient and familiarize myself with a new tool....as fast as I could! :running_man:

In the world of data, the tech and tools we use are constantly changing and the ability to pick up news skills FAST is essential if ya want to keep up...

[Holisitcs](https://www.holistics.io/) is a self service style BI tool which before this project, I hadn't heard of or had experience with. You don't need technical skills to use it, but a data savy individual is needed for data modeling and general setup.

The dashboard is no longer available, but :arrow_down:below:arrow_down: is a link to a video presentation of the project!
